# Rubiks-Cube
Modelling and solving of a rubiks cube 

Using numpy array to model cube as of current

lots to consider, coding each move as of now just need to think of orientation
the solvig is going to be complex, as it will either be very inefficient (searching for best move)
or very slow (searching for quickest move and doing a drawn out approaach to solving in lots of moves)
